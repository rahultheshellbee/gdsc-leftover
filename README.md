I got to know about the soulution challeng on 13th march 2022,
so i could not complete the project,
the app and cloud work is still being prepared,
we are planning to finalize the project "LEFTOVER" in mid of april.

Every updates of the project will be updated in this repository.
Thankyou:)

Update 12/04/2022
Today a incomplete web application is created to show the the interface, but not built fully working app, due to less resource.
Link for webapp: https://ratsms.site/leftover/index.php#exampleModalToggle6
Actually the plan is to make a android based application, but we could not make 1 due to less resource and time(we got to know about solution challenge 2022 in the end time of submission, we didn't even got 1 full month to work on it), so one of my team member has some basic skills of building web application.
So tried our best in time that we has, still we are working on the project to complete it.
Thank you:)
